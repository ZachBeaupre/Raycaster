a little passion project
basically a glorified tech demo
just something i made for a school project by myself, and then after turning it in continued to work on it and add features. 

i just wanted to put it here to show it off, and maybe even have people play it. 
This is not made to be pretty. I did not intend for others to read this code. I normally put comments in my code, but here i was the only one that would use it.
so if you read this google, apple, microsoft or something, just know that this is my greatest creation but it isnt my most professional of projects

features

raycaster that takes line2D.Double objects as map data to make mazes
has pointerLock for player direction

WASD

SVG parsing - mazegenerator.net allows you to download svg of the maze and my program can parse all of those that only use straight lines and polylines

I implemented Circles for some reason because I was bored haha

functional key and door system. Each door is treated as an object, and it can only be opened if the player has the correct key for that door, and has it currently selected in thier key ring.

The raycaster uses color that is shaded based on the distance from the closest wall geometry to the players eyes, also the different objects in the world are colored differently. map geometry and the newly added circles are yellow, keys are a dark blue and always rotate to face the players coordinates, and  

WASD for movement, move mouse to look around or use the arrow keys.

Scroll wheel or Q key to select a key from the key ring

E to use key on door.
